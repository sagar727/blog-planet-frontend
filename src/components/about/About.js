      <p>
        Hi, I’m Sagar – a software developer with a passion for coding and a
        love for turning ideas into powerful applications. My journey in tech
        has led me to master various programming languages and frameworks,
        including Java, Kotlin, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Swift, and MySQL,
        alongside backend tools like Firebase. With hands-on experience in
        mobile app development, I’ve built native Android apps using Android
        Studio and iOS apps with Xcode, along with cross-platform applications
        using React Native. <br></br>
        <br></br> I enjoy creating seamless user experiences across platforms
        and have developed RESTful APIs using Spring Boot with Java, alongside
        frontends in React.js. Currently, I’m delving into exciting new tools
        like Jetpack Compose for Android and SwiftUI for iOS to expand my
        toolkit even further.<br></br>
        <br></br> You can find my work on GitHub, where I’m also exploring
        Docker containerization and Kubernetes for efficient deployment and
        orchestration. For me, coding isn’t just a job – it’s a constant journey
        of learning, creating, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.
        <br></br>
        <br></br> This description communicates your skills and your dedication
        to growth, making it a great introduction for readers and potential
        collaborators alike!
